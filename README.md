**Vacuum manifold**
To assemble this, you need:
1) 14 M3 20mm hex head (ideally) screws
2) 13 5.5M M3 square nuts
3) A sheet of neoprene or equivalent rubber - I just went to a local rubber store and bought a few sheets and tried out a range.


To assemble, place the thin piece of printed plastic over the neoprene and cut around it to create the rubber layer that will act as the seal. This piece of plastic is just a stencil to get the size right - adjust to make sure it fits with your plates.

Use the top piece of plastic with the screw holes in it and place it over the neoprene and use a drill to make holes in the right spaces on the neoprene.

Align this piece with the neoprene and push the screws through the holes in the top piece of plastic and the neoprene.

Using a soldering iron, gently heat up the square nuts and push them into the holes in the side of the main piece, this will act as a thread to help the screws screw in it. Make sure the thread aligns with the screw hole.

Align the neoprene and plastic piece, and gently screw everything together. If you want, apply a layer of silicone on the outside to help make it airtight. 

I printed this with 15% infill, PLA, 0.3mm layer height, and with 20mm brim. I customized supports to have supports only on the vacuum pump attachment - so no supports were in the slots for the nuts. 

Do not use anything particularly reactive or toxic with this, unless you seal it fully with epoxy resin for similar - as you risk damaging the manifold. After use, rinse with sterile water into a waste container. Currently we have this set up to feed into a waste flask to which the vacuum pump is applied to - so that the liquid waste (and water after rinsing) is easily collected. Do not autoclave, or heat up to dry - just pat dry then leave to fully air dry. 

Future iterations will have a slot for a glass tank to collect the liquid waste so it doesn't come in direct contact with the manifold.
